<p>I have created a Task Manager using ‘CodeIgniter”. The features that have been included in the website are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register</li>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Add a task</li>
<li>Update a task</li>
<li>Delete a task</li>
<li>View a task </li>
<li>Active record</li>
<li>Sets Ascending order by Due_date</li>
<li>Displays the date and time of each task when added</li>
</ul>

<p>The advance feature that I have included is to set an active record that gets the date from database and if the due date is less than the date 3 days from now it displays the task.</p>
